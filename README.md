The code, if any, for UCACCMET2J 2017.

LOL let's add a random change to this file just for shits and giggles.

Actually I changed my mind. Let's add some actually relevant information. In order to make a new commit, you gotta type "git commit -a" into bash, meaning basically 'commit all changes made in this repository'. Bash will then let you enter 'vim', the text editor inside the CL, to add md on what you actually changed. Type a comment, THEN DO THE FOLLOWING:
press escape
type :wq - meaning 'write and quit'. Doing this wrong means you get stuck in 'vim', which sucks. Press enter.
Voila!
